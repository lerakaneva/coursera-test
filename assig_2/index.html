In recent years, tom yum has been popularised around the world. Commercial tom yum paste is made by crushing all the herb ingredients and stir frying in oil. Seasoning and other preservative ingredients are then added.  Tom yum flavored with the paste may have different characteristics from that made with fresh herb ingredients. </p></section></div>
		<div class="col-ld-4 col-md-6 col-sd-12">  <section id = "s2"> <h2 id = "h2"> Borscht </h2> <p>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht" is most often associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht and cabbage borscht.                                                                     </p></section> </div>
		<div class="col-ld-4 col-md-12 col-sd-12">  <section id = "s3"> <h2 id = "h3"> Bouillabaisse </h2> <p> Bouillabaisse is a traditional Provençal fish stew originating from the port city of Marseille. The French and English form bouillabaisse comes from the Provençal Occitan word bolhabaissa, a compound that consists of the two verbs bolhir (to boil) and abaissar. What makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Provençal herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil.  </p></section></div>
